 How It Works

 	1.	Input Selection:

	3.	Poster Retrieval:
	‚Ä¢	Movie IDs from the dataset are used to fetch posters via the TMDb API.
	‚Ä¢	The posters are displayed alongside the recommended movies.
	4.	Interactive Output:
	‚Ä¢	Recommendations and posters are displayed in a responsive grid layout.
